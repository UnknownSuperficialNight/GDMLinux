## Installation

Install commands

```bash
  wget 'https://github.com/UnknownSuperficialNight/GDMLinux/releases/download/v0.1/GDMLinux.sh'
  chmod +x 'GDMLinux.sh'
```
Don't put the bash file in the Grim Dawn directory it will work but it will just be messy try installing in a location where you can keep this permanently my choice is ~/Games
## Usage

```bash
./GDMLinux.sh
```

## Uninstall
I wont make a script here this will be manual since it's so easy just remove the following directorys and files and you are done
- cache
- tmp_grim_GDML
- gum
- GDMLinux.sh

## Author Removal

If you are the author of one of these mods and you want me to remove your mod make a issue and i will remove it :)

## Future temp Notes 

It will be awhile till i can get GrimTex working since id have to set up my own delivery of the files since the websites it's hosted on wont work with scripts
